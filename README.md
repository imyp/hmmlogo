# Visualizations for profile hidden Markov models

The HMMLogo package makes it easy to create visualizations for profile hidden Markov models (pHMMs).


# Introduction

[Pfam](https://pfam.xfam.org/) is a database stores information about
conserved protein domains and protein families. Protein families are
modelled using pHMMs, because such models hold information about
conservation and variability within family members. HMM logos are used
to easily visualize and identify trends in pHMMs.
