#+title:Sequence logos for profile hidden Markov models
* Introduction

  [[https://pfam.xfam.org/][Pfam]] is a protein database that collects information about protein
  families and domains.  Profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used
  to classify the protein families and hold information about
  conservation and variability within family members.  Sequence logos
  are graphical representations of biological sequence alignments or
  HMMs.

* Process

  The process of visualizing a sequence logo from a pfam accession
  number requires the following steps:

  - downloading the hmm from pfam.xfam.org

  - piping through hmmlogo to create logo

  - reading logo into pandas dataframe

  - plotting the logo to a matplotlib figure

  - saving figure as to file-like object
